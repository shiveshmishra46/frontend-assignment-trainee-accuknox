# Frontend Dashboard - Final (PDF-accurate implementation)

This project is built to closely follow the uploaded assignment PDF visualization and requirements:
- JSON-driven categories & widgets.
- Dynamic add/remove widgets (store in Zustand).
- Exact label: "CSPM Executive dashboard" and widget panel.
- SVG charts (Line, Bar, Donut) with simulated realtime updates.
- No placeholder images; charts are live-simulated.

Run:
1. npm install
2. npm start
